### About Full Remote :ok_hand:

We took the liberty to define full remote as follows:

- All staff can work remote.
  - Must apply to _all staff_ for full remote consideration.

* Workplace is flexible by definition.
  - Must allow remote work up to 2 days a week.

### English Friendly

We define English Friendly as follows:

- requiring only English language ability (i.e. very little or zero Japanese) to perform all tasks required of a position.
