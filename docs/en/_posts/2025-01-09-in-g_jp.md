description: 'We started as a company established in Yokohama in 2010. We were a contracted developer at the time of establishment, but now we mainly focus on developing our own services as follows.  ・Survey service : ”Smile Survey” ・Reservation service (Planned for Commercialization) : Currently offering this service as a core solution for major apparel events, golf courses, online medical clinics, etc. ・Matching service (Planned for Commercialization) : Currently offering this service as a core solution for direct recruiting, real estate sales, CrowdWorks, etc.  As our company name suggests, we have a vision of “evolving day by day”, and we invite you to join us in creating services that change the world with software! Full remote working is OK (several employees live in Kyushu and Kansai), and mothers working shorter hours are also thriving in our company. The office is directly connected to Nihon-Odori Station on the Minatomirai Line, so you won’t need an umbrella even on rainy days!'
