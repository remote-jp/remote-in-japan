SmartHR is an HR/Labor SaaS that allows companies to completely digitzalize onboarding paperwork, tax forms, and other labor procedures that have traditionally been all done on paper.  By integrating our service with the e-Gov API offered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, companies can submit their paperwork entirely online to government offices.  As a result, management, HR personnel, and employees are liberated from doing time-consuming and difficult paperwork.  In 2018, SmartHR was selected as one of the companies for the J-Startup program, sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry which aims to create unicorn companies out of Japan.  In 2019, we established our first branch office in the Kansai region of Japan.(Hiring)</span>
